Odometer statement still has a new dealer signature box at the bottom.
App: Odometer statement -> Send button need bigger size and pronounced 
Need in alphabetical order -> dealerships, users, search dealerships etc.,
Multiple rooftop users still need to show up under View users when that dealership is selected under search.
Change the pop up when the customer signs: Change the 'okay' to 'Agree'
Web: User info -> move the word 'THE': ADD & VIEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE USER
Same as #4: move 'THE' under Dealership Info
Web: Add Dealer, Make needs to be in alphabetical order
Web: Payment Details, replace 'ENTER BACK UP CARD INFO FOR RECURRING PAYMENT' with 'ENTER PAYMENT DETAILS'
Web: On dashboard, ODO, we need the option to print, send email, and send fax to remain an option after an action has been made
App: Under  Pick Up/ Drop Off/ Purchase, 'Picked by' needs to read ' Picked Up By'
App: The share button should send the lease Intake file NOT the odometer statement which is available to send via fax and email
All emails of the file (customer, manager, service, etc.) should include the customer's signature with the pop up they agreed to either below or next to their signature.  
Can we add a confirmed recall to the notifications? And Can we make the recall field available to check on motorsafety.org AFTER the file has been saved?
Once a photo is taken, we should be able to delete it and default back to the original icon image. For App its done, For web need to be worked out
We also need to add to the user permission options the ability change pick up/drop off/purchase so only those with permission can do so.
